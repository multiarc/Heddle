# Heddle

A text template engine for .NET. Heddle compiles templates written in its small, purpose‑built
language into reusable, strongly‑typed renderers. Templates can embed real C#
expressions, define and inherit reusable named blocks, compose output through extension chains,
and control HTML encoding per directive.

```heddle
@model(){{dynamic}}
<p>Hi @(Name) — you have @int(Count) new comments.</p>
```

```csharp
HeddleTemplate.Configure(typeof(Program).Assembly);

var source = "@model(){{dynamic}}\n<p>Hi @(Name) — you have @int(Count) new comments.</p>";
using var template = new HeddleTemplate(source, new CompileContext(new TemplateOptions { AllowCSharp = true }));

string html = template.Generate(new { Name = "Ada", Count = 3 });
// <p>Hi Ada — you have 3 new comments.</p>
```

## How Heddle compares

Heddle sits in a small niche: a **compiled, statically‑typed** template language whose entire
control‑flow vocabulary is *library*, not grammar. Here is where it lands against the engines
people usually weigh it against.

| | **Heddle** | Razor | Liquid / Scriban | Handlebars / Mustache | Go `text/template` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Execution | Compiled to an exec‑ready document | Compiled | Interpreted | Interpreted | Interpreted |
| Typing | **Static, per use site** | Static | Dynamic | Dynamic | Dynamic |
| Logic in templates | Full C# (opt‑in) | Full C# | Sandboxed filters | Logic‑less + helpers | Limited + funcs |
| Control flow | **Extensions (a library)** | Keywords | Tags | Block helpers | Keywords |
| Context model | Relative: current / `::`root | Absolute (`Model.X`) | Mostly global | Relative stack | Relative (`.` / `$`) |
| Composition | Definition inheritance + override | Layouts / sections / partials | Partials / includes | Partials | Heddle / blocks |
| Untrusted templates | No (or run in no‑C# mode) | No | **Yes (sandboxed)** | **Yes (logic‑less)** | Partial |
| Reach / ecosystem | .NET only, small | .NET, excellent | Large | Large, polyglot | Large |

**What's genuinely distinctive (the combination, more than any single trait):**

- **Extension‑only core.** There are no `if`/`for`/`include` keywords — those are extensions, so
  the language grows by adding a class, not by changing the grammar. The `:` chain composes them
  right‑to‑left, with a single *chained* channel carrying the loop index, the piped value, and
  `@out()` content.
- **Abstract, late‑bound sections.** A definition with no `:: Type` is compiled against the
  concrete model at *each call site* — closer to a **C++ template** (monomorphised, type‑checked
  per use) than a C# generic (compiled once behind constraints). Reuse one section across many
  model shapes, each statically checked.
- **Composition without coupling.** Definition inheritance/override are *declarative extension
  points*: unlike Razor sections (which bind "backwards" and pin the rendered page as the
  layout's final consumer), a Heddle page can be split into independent templates recombined by a
  layout with **no runtime cost**, and any page can serve as a base for another.
- **Compiled to an execution‑ready document.** A template becomes an in‑memory tree of
  extension calls wired to **compiled** accessors — member paths to expression‑tree delegates,
  embedded C# to Roslyn delegates — so nothing is reflected or re‑parsed per render. It renders
  [faster than Razor with fewer allocations](#performance) on a like‑for‑like page.

**Best fit:** performance‑sensitive, first‑party .NET rendering by a team that values typed
templates and component‑style composition. **Poor fit:** untrusted user‑supplied templates
(the security model is all‑or‑nothing on `AllowCSharp`, not a sandbox), polyglot stacks, or
teams wanting a large ecosystem and batteries‑included tooling. The language also trades some
ergonomics for its small core — dense sigils and no `else`/`elif` (compose `@if`/`@ifnot`
instead). See the [Language Reference](docs/language-reference.md) for the full picture.

## Performance

Heddle compiles each template into an **execution‑ready document** — an in‑memory tree of
extension calls wired to compiled accessors (member paths to expression‑tree delegates,
embedded C# to Roslyn delegates). Rendering walks that document, so it does not re‑parse, reflect,
or pay per‑call activation, section, or dependency‑injection overhead at run time. The
repository includes a [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/) suite
([src/Heddle.Performance](src/Heddle.Performance)) that renders a realistic home page —
a layout plus several reusable templates and a dozen component/extension invocations — and
compares it head‑to‑head against the equivalent ASP.NET Core **Razor** page
([RenderTemplateEngine vs RenderRazor](src/Heddle.Performance/TextRenderBenchmarks.cs)).

On that like‑for‑like workload, Heddle renders the page **faster than Razor and allocates less
memory** (`[MemoryDiagnoser]` is enabled). The advantage comes from two places:

- **Execution** — walking the pre‑compiled document avoids the partial/section/view‑component
  machinery Razor invokes per component (see [Architecture → Performance](docs/architecture.md#performance-characteristics)).
- **Composition** — Heddle definitions are *declarative, decoupled* extension points. Unlike Razor
  sections, which bind "backwards" and force the rendered page to be the layout's final
  consumer, a Heddle template can be split into independent reusable templates recombined by a
  layout **with no runtime cost**, and any page can itself serve as a base for another. See
  [Language Reference → inheritance](docs/language-reference.md#inheritance-and-override-childbase).

Run it yourself:

```
dotnet run -c Release --project src/Heddle.Performance
```

## Building

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
```

Requires the .NET SDK 8.0 (see [global.json](global.json)). See
[docs/building.md](docs/building.md) for details.
